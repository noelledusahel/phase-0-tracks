# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? 
Version control is a method of tracking and making changes to code allowing multiple people to work seperatly on the same code without disrupting each other's work. It also allows you to look back at code and find bugs, when they were introduced, and who the author of the code was. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one? a branch is the chain of code that you seperate from the master, which will only change the master file/directory when you decide to merge it. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit completes the change to the code you created in your branch. a good commit message communicates what was done that was committed
* What is a merge conflict? a merge conflict occurs when the changes have not been committed and remain untracked son
