Question 1: 
Within Linux is created as a open source operating system. It is designed with an open-ended, feature minded approach. According to www.opensource.com 

"Linux treats everyone equally and allows everyone the maximum amount of power. That is egalitarian. Other operating systems are elitist and exclusive because they withhold or hide their power behind an inflexible Graphical User Interface that allows one to do only what the developers think we should be allowed to do.
"

Programs in Linux follow the following design rules:

Uses shell scripts to increase leverage and portability
use software leverage: borrow well written code
Make every program a filter
