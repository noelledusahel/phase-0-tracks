2. Join 3 tables using LEFT JOIN and INNER JOIN

3.
There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

------INPUT------

SELECT reviews.comment, businesses.name, users.first_name, users.last_name FROM reviews 
...> INNER JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id
...> LEFT JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id;

------OUTPUT------

This place is alright!|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|Steven|Wonder
Still struggling through Chattaranga|Lotus Yoga|Holly|Berry
Janet is good!|Plumbing by Janet|Steven|Wonder

How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

INPUT 
SELECT businesses.name, reviews.comment, users.first_name, users.last_name FROM reviews INNER JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id LEFT JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id WHERE businesses.name = ('Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel');

OUTPUT 
Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|This place is alright!|Steven|Wonder
